That was my gateway in to design which led me too learn about programs like After Effects, Premiere Pro, and Blender. Then I heard of the Digital Design and Development Program at BCIT from a friend and it seemed like a great fit. Then comes around September 2020, the month I started D3. I entered D3 expecting to primarily a UI/UX designer, however really found my groove with coding. Since then I've found my stride with coding using React.js. I really enjoy the problem solving aspect of it "
